## 2. Ideas & Solutions

### 2.1. Introduction

The fertilizer company is facing a critical challenge in mapping free-text product names from Point of Sale (POS) transactions to the corresponding Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) in the product catalog. This issue arises due to the varied sources of product information, including partner inputs, resulting in discrepancies and inconsistencies in data.

Accurate mapping is vital for efficient inventory management and precise sales tracking. Inaccurate mapping can lead to operational inefficiencies such as overstocking or understocking, leading to additional costs. Moreover, it can obscure the true picture of product sales and trends, impacting strategic decisions about new product introductions, price adjustments, and more.

To address this issue, the Trifecta team aims to devise a robust solution. This solution would involve a detailed SKU performance analysis and a systematic SKU rationalization process, ensuring each product in the POS transactions can be accurately mapped to the corresponding SKUs in the product catalog.

Through this approach, we aim to enhance operational efficiency and sales tracking accuracy for the fertilizer company, enabling them to make more informed decisions based on consistent and accurate data.
